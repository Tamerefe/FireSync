    This is a weapon battle game where you compete against the computer.

    Each round:
    1. You get a budget to buy weapons
    2. Choose a weapon from the available options
    3. Computer selects a weapon
    4. Weapons are compared using balanced score
    5. Higher score wins the round

    Balanced Score Formula:
    ((Damage √ó Fire Rate) + (Magazine √ó Range)) / (Falloff + Recoil)

    You can sell weapons for 70% of their original price.
    Winning gives you $500 bonus, losing gives $200 bonus.

    Random events may affect weapon performance during rounds.

    CONTROLS:
    - Use number keys (1, 2, 3...) to make selections
    - Press Enter to continue
    - Type 'y' or 'e' for yes, 'n' for no

    TIPS:
    - Consider weapon DPS and balanced score
    - Use attachments to improve weapon performance
    - Choose perks that match your strategy
    - Monitor your balance carefully
    - Random events affect both players equally
