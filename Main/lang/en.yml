    This is a weapon battle game where you compete against the computer.
    
    Each round:
    1. You get a budget to buy weapons
    2. Choose a weapon from the available options
    3. Computer selects a weapon
    4. Weapons are compared using balanced score
    5. Higher score wins the round
    
    Balanced Score Formula:
    ((Damage √ó Fire Rate) + (Magazine √ó Range)) / (Falloff + Recoil)
    
    You can sell weapons for 70% of their original price.
    Winning gives you $500 bonus, losing gives $200 bonus.
    
    Random events may affect weapon performance during rounds.
